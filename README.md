# Scraping & Visualization
### [Stock Dividend Yield Scraper](https://github.com/jayhoneylee527/Stock-Dividend-Yield-Scraper) ###

I am currently investing in stocks, including Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). One of the most significant factors I consider when investing in REITs is their dividend yields. Depending on the types of industries the funds invest and their market capital, their sharing of profits with the investors vary; I needed to build a simple table that will display list of dividend yields, so that I can compare the returns and rebalance my portfolio.

# Streamlit Application 
###  [FIFA22 Player DB](https://github.com/jayhoneylee527/FIFA22-PlayerDB) ###

As a serious FIFA player (challenge accepted anytime) I have to know the traits of each player to build an ideal team on a career mode. Although everyone hopes to create an an All Star team with Messi and Ronaldo, it is not only expensive but also in fact, not so economical. The App I created through Streamlit helps users with two essential functions:

1) Visualize each player's abilities and their values as well as other players with similar traits.

2) Filter players by the traits including their abilities, age, market value and etc.  

With this tool, users can find a nice replacement for the world-class player at an affordable market value.
