# Scraping & Visualization
### [Stock Dividend Yield Scraper](https://github.com/jayhoneylee527/Stock-Dividend-Yield-Scraper) ###

I am currently investing in stocks, including Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). One of the most significant factors I consider when investing in REITs is their dividend yields. Depending on the types of industries the funds invest and their sizes, their sharing of profits with the investors vary; I needed to build a simple table that will display list of dividend yields, so that I can compare the returns and rebalance my portfolio.
